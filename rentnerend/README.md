I'm so done with refactoring this rn
Here's a list of features cause maybe it will help.

- input window:
	- changing counters
	- editing json
	- selecting json
	- uploading score to the internet
	- connecting with websockets

and here are questions i need to be answered to go on

- what qt widgets do need to be in the heap?

total 0

displaywindow.cpp
displaywindow.hpp
inputwindow.cpp
inputwindow.hpp
main.cpp
publish.cpp
publish.hpp
websockets.cpp
websockets.hpp
wizard.cpp
wizard.hpp

## what we have to do until the next minor event
- json editor
- inputwindow
- displaywindow
- compilation to windows:
	- including finding datapath
