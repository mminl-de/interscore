# Interscore
An overlay for OBS Studio that displays scores and other info about streamed sports games.

## About
The OBS overlay is a single HTML file launched via the Browser source.
The DOM contents are controlled via the WebSocket protocol using a CLI server program, meant for admins.
Another client uses Qt6 and is meant for the referees and the public display in the hall. The can change the HTML contents by using the server as the middleman.

Tournament metadata (competing teams, timer lengths, game plan) is fed using a JSON file.

The overlay supports multiple "widgets" showing goals and the timer, teams participating in the tournament, currently playing teams and even red and yellow cards.

This project was made for our personal use in a Cycleball tournament under hilarious deadlines.

## Usage
1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/hiimsergey/interscore && cd interscore`
2. Ensure your OBS edition supports Browser Source.
3. Compile the frontend script and the binaries with `make js b-install r-install`.
4. Fill out `input.json` given the template at `input.template.json`.
5. Open `frontnend/index.html` in OBS Studio and set appropriate dimensions.
6. Launch the `interscore` binary.
7. Give the `interscore-rentnerend` binary to your nearest referee.
8. Reload the HTML page so that you see `Client upgraded to WebSocket connection!` in the backend terminal.
9. Press `?` (followed by Enter/Return) in the backend terminal to see possible actions.

# TODO

## right after performance
- tidy up assets folder (especially logo.svg)
- remoteend:
	- idiomatic restructuring
	- tight packing of five switches
	- server sends back active widgets
	- layout: change port above switches
	- remoteend looks for first match, without hard coded ip
- website:
	- rewrite:
		- fully mobile-friendly
		- more images:
			- widgets
		- tutorial page
